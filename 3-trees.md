# Trees
While working with directories or file systems, we might occasionally be interested in organizing our data in a hierarchical order. We might want to have the most significant item or origin in the top and less relevant elements in sublevels. Most data structures provide a linear configuration to insert or arrange data; however, one of the data structures that allow the user to apply a hierarchical arrangement is called **Tree**. This organizational format works similar to a linked list due to it uses pointers, also called edges, to connect nodes. One big difference, though, is that this structure allows connecting more than one node to the tree at the same level. How this data structure grows is by creating branches where we can store more data, and each branch can have multiple branches just like a tree, hence the name. Next section provides more details on how this structure is formed.

## Structure
There are several types of trees we could talk about; however, we will limit our study to only three of them. We would like to begin by introducing the binary trees. Unlike a general tree that can multiple nodes per level, a **binary tree** can only allocate two nodes per sublevel and each branch created by each of these two nodes can only have two other subnodes and so forth. Hence the name binary tree. The node from where our binary tree begins, origin or top, is commonly known as **root**. The branches created by the subnodes are called **subtrees**. Most of the nodes have a parent-child relationship. The subnode connected to an upper node is usually called **child** and the upper node to which the subnode is connected is called **parent**. Each child node, as mentioned previously, generally forms a subtree. Nodes that don't have any children are called **leaves**. The links used to connect one node to another are called **edges**; they are usually represented as arrows or lines in the diagrams.
