# Python Data Structure Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Data Structure Tutorial. The following links provide descriptions and instructions in how to use these data structure:

* [Queues](1-queue.md)
* [Linked Lists](2-linked-list.md)
* [Trees](3-trees.md)

In these tutorials, you will have the opportunity to learn the main characteristics, properties and structure of these data structures. You will find the proper syntax in order to use them in Python along with real world application examples of them. At the end of each tutorial, there is a practice problem which you can try to solve to gain some experience using these data structures. Once you are done solving the problem, you can access the solutions to compare them with your actual solution. I hope you enjoy it!
